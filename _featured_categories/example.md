  <h3>
  I am a Software Engineer at Chan Zuckerberg Initiative - imaging and I earned a Master's degree in Computer Science(Robotics and Artificial Intelligence) at Arizona State University. I had the privilege of being a member of the Active Perception Group at the Arizona State university, where I had the opportunity to work under the guidance of Prof. Yezhou Yang and receive co-advisement from Prof. Yi Ren.

  My research interests revolve around Computer Vision, Adversarial Attacks, and Generative Models. Specifically, my main focus is on preventing the misuse of synthetic content generated by generative models when subjected to adversarial perturbations. I aim to enhance the robustness of these models by embedding attributable watermarks, particularly in speech generative models like Text-to-Speech synthesis and voice conversion systems. By doing so, I strive to ensure secure development and improve resistance against various post-processing attacks.
