# About Me  

I am a **Software Engineer at Chan Zuckerberg Initiative - Imaging**, where I focus on developing high-performance, scalable machine learning and data processing solutions. My work involves integrating large language models (LLMs) and building robust platforms to enhance scientific research efficiency, particularly in biological imaging and AI-driven analysis.

I earned my **Master’s degree in Computer Science (Robotics and Artificial Intelligence)** from **Arizona State University**, where I had the privilege of being a member of the **Active Perception Group (APG)**. Under the guidance of **Prof. Yezhou Yang** and co-advisement from **Prof. Yi Ren**, I explored advanced research in **Computer Vision, Adversarial Attacks, and Generative Models**.

My research primarily focused on **preventing the misuse of synthetic content generated by generative models when subjected to adversarial perturbations**. I worked on embedding **attributable watermarks** to enhance the security and traceability of **speech generative models**, such as **Text-to-Speech synthesis and voice conversion systems**, ensuring resistance against various post-processing attacks.

Prior to my graduate studies, I earned my **Bachelor’s degree in Computer and Information Science** from **University of Arizona**, with a minor in **Business Administration**.  

Beyond my professional and academic pursuits, I am passionate about **overcoming challenges and continuously learning**. I believe that **innovation thrives in curiosity and perseverance**, and I embrace every opportunity to explore new technologies and expand my expertise.
